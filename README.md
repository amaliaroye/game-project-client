# Project One: Tic-Tac-Toe
This application allows the user to do x, y, and z. Maybe here's a reason why I wanted to do this project, or came up with this idea.

## Planning
### User Stories
- As a new user, I want to be able to create a new account so I can play a game
- As a returning user, I want to be able to log into my account with the correct password and play
- I want to be able to know if the username and password I entered are incorrect
- I want to be able to change my log in password after successfully logging in
- I want to be able to sign out of my account and exit the game with the option of signing back in to play again
- I want to be able to start a new game and click on empty squares until either player wins, or if there are no available spaces on the board
- I want to be able to see who won or if there was a tie after the game is over with the option of playing again or exiting and signing out
